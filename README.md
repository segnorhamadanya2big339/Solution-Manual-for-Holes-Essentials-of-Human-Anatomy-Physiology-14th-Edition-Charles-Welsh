  * * Author:  Charles Welsh
   
  * Designed for the one-semester anatomy and physiology course, Hole's Essentials of Human Anatomy and Physiology assumes no prior science knowledge and supports core topics with clinical applications, making difficult concepts relevant to students pursuing careers in the allied health field. The Learn, Practice, and Access system is used throughout the text and digital content for immediate application. "Learning" outcomes begin the chapter and set the stage for what students will learn, "Practice" questions conclude each major section and help students recall the information they’ve consumed, and "Assess" end-of-chapter resources allow students to confirm their accurate recall of what they learned and practiced. The learn, practice, and assess system is highly effective in providing students with a solid understanding of the important concepts in anatomy and physiology.
